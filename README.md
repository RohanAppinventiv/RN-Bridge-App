A professional open-source React Native project demonstrating a robust bridge to native Android code for EMV payment processing on the PAX A920 Pro device. This project integrates a native Android library (`dsiEMVAndroid.aar` from DataCap Inc.) via a Kotlin-based module, enabling seamless payment flows from JavaScript to hardware.

## üöÄ Features
- **React Native ‚ÜîÔ∏è Native Android Bridge**: Call native EMV payment functions from JS.
- **PAX A920 Pro Support**: Full integration with PAX payment hardware.
- **Kotlin Native Module**: Modern, idiomatic Kotlin code for Android bridging.
- **dsiEMVAndroid.aar Integration**: Uses DataCap's secure EMV payment SDK.
- **Async/Promise-based API**: Clean, promise-based interface for React Native.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to adapt for other payment SDKs or devices.

```

### 2. Install JS Dependencies
```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Android Native Setup
- Open `android/` in Android Studio.
- Ensure `dsiEMVAndroid.aar` is present in `android/emvlib/libs/`.
- Connect your PAX A920 Pro device or start an emulator.
